# Play 
Using Django on the back-end and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Bootstrap on the front-end, I have created a project that allows users to play a game of hangman. 

## Navigating the file system: 
   - :open_file_folder: **game** : root folder for game app
      -  :open_file_folder: **static/game** : Contains static files like image files, css files and JS files
           -   :open_file_folder: **index.js** : contains javascript code for the django project 
           -   :open_file_folder: **inherit.css** : CSS style file for the django project 
           -   :open_file_folder: **register.css** : CSS style file for the django project 
      -  :open_file_folder: **templates/game** : Contains HTML  files 
      -  :open_file_folder: **model.py** : Contains the models for the database which is in SQLite 
      -  :open_file_folder: **urls.py** : Contains the routes for the game app 
      -  :open_file_folder: **views.py** : Contains the functions that render views for this app
