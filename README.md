# Play 
Using Django on the back-end and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Bootstrap on the front-end, I have created a project that allows users to play a game of hangman. The user can register, login, logout, keep track of their progress, play hangman, have friends and chat. I made this project after completing CS50 web development with Python and JavaScript
